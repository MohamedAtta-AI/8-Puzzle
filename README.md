# 8-Puzzle
This is an old assignment I made by myself in my sophomore year :)

Description:
An application of Artificial Intelligence is used to solve a famous problem known as the N-Puzzle. Non-informed search algorithms such as Breadth-First search and Depth-First search are proposed and implemented to solve the 8-Puzzle version.

[AI Report.pdf](https://github.com/MohamedAtta-AI/8-Puzzle/blob/main/AI%20Report.pdf) provides a detailed explanation of the approach and code.
